    "This Python code defines a function to count the number of lines, words, and characters in a text file. Let me break it down step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Function Definition**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def count_txt_file(file_path):\n",
    "```\n",
    "This defines a function named `count_txt_file` that takes one parameter, `file_path`, which represents the location of the file to be analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. File Handling**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The `open` function opens the file `example.txt` in **read mode ('r')**.\n",
    "- The `with` statement ensures the file is properly closed after the operation, even if an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Read Lines**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lines = file.readlines()\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `file.readlines()` reads all lines of the file into a list called `lines`. Each element in this list represents a single line in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Count Lines**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "line_count = len(lines)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `len(lines)` calculates the total number of elements (lines) in the `lines` list, giving the **number of lines** in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Count Words**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "word_count = sum(len(line.split()) for line in lines)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This is a generator expression:\n",
    "  - `line.split()` splits each line into words using spaces as separators (default behavior of `split()`).\n",
    "  - `len(line.split())` calculates the number of words in a line.\n",
    "- The `sum()` function adds up all the word counts for each line, resulting in the **total number of words** in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Count Characters**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "char_count = sum(len(line) for line in lines)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Another generator expression:\n",
    "  - `len(line)` calculates the total number of characters (including spaces and newline characters) in a line.\n",
    "- The `sum()` function adds up all character counts for all lines, resulting in the **total number of characters** in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Return Results**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "return line_count, word_count, char_count\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The function returns a tuple containing the number of lines, words, and characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Call the Function**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file_path = 'example.txt'\n",
    "lines, words, characters = count_txt_file(file_path)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The `count_txt_file` function is called with the file path `'example.txt'`.\n",
    "- The returned tuple is unpacked into three variables: `lines`, `words`, and `characters`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. Print Results**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(f\"The no lines: {lines}, The no of Words: {words}, The No of Characters: {characters}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This uses an **f-string** to format and print the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Output (for a hypothetical `example.txt` file):\n",
    "```\n",
    "The no lines: 10, The no of Words: 50, The No of Characters: 300\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Points**\n",
    "1. **File Path**: Currently, the code hardcodes `'example.txt'` in `open`. To analyze a file based on the `file_path` argument, replace it with `open(file_path, 'r')`.\n",
    "2. **Character Count**: The character count includes newline characters (`\\n`), spaces, and other visible/non-visible characters.\n",
    "3. **Robustness**: Add error handling (e.g., `try...except`) to handle cases like missing files or incorrect file paths.\n",
