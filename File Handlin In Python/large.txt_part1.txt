YouTube is a leading online video-sharing platform that was founded on February 14, 2005, by Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim, three former PayPal employees. Initially conceived as a dating site, it quickly pivoted to video sharing after the founders recognized a gap in the market for an easy-to-use platform for uploading and viewing videos. Google acquired YouTube in November 2006 for $1.65 billion, allowing it to grow significantly as a subsidiary.

The platform enables users to upload, share, and view a vast array of content, including music videos, educational tutorials, vlogs, and live streams. With over 500 hours of video uploaded every minute and more than one billion hours of content watched daily, YouTube has become a central hub for entertainment and information globally. It supports user interaction through comments, likes, and subscriptions, fostering a sense of community among creators and viewers.

Despite its success, YouTube has faced criticism regarding copyright issues, content moderation challenges, and the impact of its recommendation algorithms. Nevertheless, it remains one of the most popular websites in the world, continually evolving with features like YouTube Premium and Shorts to cater to diverse audience needs.
